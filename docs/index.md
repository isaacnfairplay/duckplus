# DuckPlus documentation

DuckPlus pairs typed expressions with immutable DuckDB relations to keep analytics
pipelines debuggable. The documentation is versioned so changes in each release
stay easy to follow.

Use the version switcher in the navigation bar to browse documentation for
older releases once they are published.
