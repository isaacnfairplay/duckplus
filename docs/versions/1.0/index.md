# DuckPlus 1.0

DuckPlus 1.0 introduces a cohesive workflow for managing DuckDB relations with
immutable semantics, typed expression helpers, and curated IO adapters. The API
surface adheres to the open/closed principle: new capabilities are layered on
top of the existing connection, relation, and typed expression primitives
without forcing breaking changes. The reference documentation is divided into
guides that mirror the main developer journeysâ€”from opening a managed connection
to shipping data products.

If you are upgrading from an earlier preview, the {doc}`getting_started`
chapter highlights the stable import paths, while the deep-dive guides explain
how each helper composes with DuckDB.
