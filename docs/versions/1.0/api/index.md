# DuckPlus 1.0 API reference

The DuckPlus 1.0 API is organised around a managed connection, immutable
relations, and a typed expression DSL. This reference mirrors the Python package
layout so you can jump directly from an import path to the documented classes
and functions. Every public helper is described along with its parameters,
return values, and runtime behaviour. Internal utilities prefixed with an
underscore are intentionally omitted.
