# DuckDB demo parity guides

DuckDB's public demo catalog showcases how the engine queries local files,
remote datasets, nested JSON, and in-memory data frames without leaving SQL.
This section mirrors each of those workflows with DuckPlus so teams adopting the
immutable API can recognise familiar entry points. The snippets run against the
published ``duckplus`` package and assume Python 3.11+ with DuckDB 0.10 or
newer.
